Test tasks from the "Java Spring-Summer 2022" program of Epam University.

Description:
Please, proceed to the QuadraticEquation class and implement a program to solve quadratic equations.

For the given quadratic equation coefficients (ax² + bx + c = 0), return one or two roots of the equation if there is any in the set of real numbers.

Input value is given via System.in. Output value must be printed to System.out.

Output format is:

"x₁ x₂" (two roots in any order separated by space) if there are two roots
"x" (just the value of the root) if there is the only root
"no roots" (just a string value "no roots") if there is no root
The a parameter is guaranteed to be not zero.

Hint: Quadratic formula reference
