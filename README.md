Test tasks from the "Java Spring-Summer 2022" program of Epam University.

Description:
Please, proceed to HelloStrangers class and write a program that:

Asks for a number - amount of strangers to meet
Then reads stranger names line by line
And, finally, prints line by line "Hello, stranger name" for each stranger
It is guaranteed that the input is not null. It is guaranteed that the input of strangers count is int number.

Consider special cases:

If strangers count is zero, then program must print "Oh, it looks like there is no one here".
If strangers count is negative, then program must print "Seriously? Why so negative?".
