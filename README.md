# javaEpamUni
Test tasks from the "Java Spring-Summer 2022" program of Epam University.

Description:
In this exercise you need to extend DecrementingCarousel. You need to implement HalvingCarousel. This subclass must halve elements instead of decrementing it by one. Note that you need to apply regular integer division, discarding the remainder. For example, 5 / 2 = 2.
