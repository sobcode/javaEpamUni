Test tasks from the "Java Spring-Summer 2022" program of Epam University.

Description:
In this exercise you need to extend DecrementingCarousel. You need to implement GraduallyDecreasingCarousel. This subclass must decrement elements by gradually increasing decrement. When you need to decrement an element for the first time, decrease it by 1. Next time you need to decrement the same element, decrease it by 2. Next time decrease by 3, then by 4 and so on. Remember that you must not make process non-positive elements.
