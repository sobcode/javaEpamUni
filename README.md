Description:
Please, proceed to MultiplyMatrix class and implement its multiply method.

It takes two rectangular integer arrays (matrices) and returns the result of their multiplication.

Consider two integer matrices represented as rectangular arrays. The task is to multiply given matrices. The definition of matrix multiplication indicates a row-by-column multiplication, where the entries in the i-th row of A are multiplied by the corresponding entries in the j-th column of B and then the ij-th element of the resulting matrix is the sum of that multiplication results.

Note that it is guaranteed that the number of columns in the first matrix is equal to the number of rows in the second matrix.
