Test tasks from the "Java Spring-Summer 2022" program of Epam University.

Description:
In this exercise you need to extend DecrementingCarousel. You need to implement GraduallyDecreasingCarousel. This subclass must decrement elements as a usual DecrementingCarousel. The difference is that this implementation must produce a carousel run, which limits number of calls to the next method. When the limit of calls reached carousel run must consider itself finished.
